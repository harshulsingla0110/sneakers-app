## Assumptions and Decisions
**Language Choice :**
 Developed the app using Kotlin as per the preference mentioned in the assignment.

**UI Design :**
 Designed a simple and functional UI with a focus on usability and performance. Used bottom navigation for easy navigation between screens.

**Data Source :**
 Used hardcoded data instead of calling a REST API, as per the assignment instructions.

**Page Size :**
 Set the page size for pagination to 5, considering usability and performance aspects.

 ## Test Cases

**Hilt Modules and Dependencies :**
Included test cases to verify the correctness of Hilt modules and dependencies setup.

**Room Database Operations :**
Added test cases to ensure that Room database operations such as insertion, retrieval, and deletion are working correctly.
